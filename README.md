# Cyclistic-Bike-Sharing-User-Analysis
# **Introduction**

Cyclistic, a leading bike-share service headquartered in Chicago, offers a convenient and efficient urban transportation solution. Its service enables users to rent bicycles for varying durations, supported by an easy-to-use mobile application and strategically placed docking stations. Cyclistic is dedicated to accommodating diverse user requirements through a variety of membership options, including single-ride passes, daily passes, as well as monthly and annual memberships.
Consequently, this project aims to analyze the usage patterns of casual riders compared to annual members of Cyclistic bikes. Leveraging these insights, the team will develop a new marketing strategy focused on converting casual riders into annual members.

# Recommendations/Data Insights:
1. Cyclistic can encourage casual riders used bikes during weekdays more often by new membership plan with weekday discounts or one-time discounts for rides during weekdays.
2. To convert casual riders to members successfully, marketing team could announce free-trial plan as experience for non-member riders to check the benefits.
3. The busiest time during the day is “AFTERNOON 13:00–17:00”, Cyclistic could focus on what the company can do to encourage all riders use bikes in the morning and evening, too. For example, special discount on the specific time period.
4. Summer (Jun.-Aug.) was the peak of the year. Cyclistic could think about how to increase the business in other seasons as well to balance the whole year earned value.
5. Electric bikes are the most popular type, also in casual riders’ group. Cyclistic could check the profit of each bike type and think either to focus on business on electric bikes more or try to increase business on other more profitable bike types.
6. Casual riders use their bikes for longer durations than members. Offering discounts for longer rides may incentivize casual riders and entice members to ride for longer periods of time.
