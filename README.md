# Recommendations/Data Insights:
1. Cyclistic can boost weekday usage among casual riders by offering new membership plans with weekday discounts or one-time ride discounts during weekdays.Additionally, offering a free-trial plan for non-members can showcase the benefits and encourage membership.
2. The busiest time is "AFTERNOON 12:00–15:00." Cyclistic can encourage bike usage during other times by offering special discounts on the specific time period.
3. Summer (May-Sept) is the peak season. Cyclistic should explore strategies to boost ridership in other seasons to achieve year-round revenue balance.
4. Casual riders typically ride longer than members. Offering discounts for longer rides could encourage casual riders and motivate members to ride longer periods of time.
5. Docked bikes are the most popular type, also in casual riders’ group. Cyclistic could check the profit of each bike type and think either to focus on business on Docked bikes more or try to increase business on other more profitable bike types.
